# Building Modern Websites with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building modern web applications. Let's explore why and how to use it effectively.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features that make it an excellent choice for modern web development:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - Better SEO
   - Faster initial page loads
   - Improved performance

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
   - Pre-rendered pages
   - Optimal performance
   - Lower server costs

3. **File-based Routing**
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Easy to understand
   - No complex configurations

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Next.js page component:

```typescript
import { type NextPage } from 'next';

const HomePage: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto">
      <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p>Built with Next.js and TypeScript</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

## Working with Data

Next.js makes it easy to fetch and manage data. Here's an example using `getStaticProps`:

```typescript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchSomeData();
  
  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
    revalidate: 60, // Regenerate page every 60 seconds
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always optimize images using `next/image`
2. Implement proper SEO using metadata
3. Use TypeScript for better type safety
4. Follow the App Router directory structure
